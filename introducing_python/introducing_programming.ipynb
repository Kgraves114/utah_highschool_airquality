    "You and speak to each other in English. Computers don't understand English. Each computer has its own language known as **machine language**.  For humans to write a computer program in machine language is tedious, so people have invented **higher language** programming languages along with programs that *translate (interpret)* that high level program to machine language. \n",

    "The high level programming language we are going to use is [Python](www.python.org), which despite using a snake as its symbol is named after  [Monty Python](), the British comedy troupe.\n",
